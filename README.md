# ðŸŽ¨ Romish.gg Frontend

This is the **Vue 3 frontend** for the Romish.gg matchmaking system â€” a full CS2 10-man web platform connected to a Node.js backend and DatHost servers.

## ðŸ§  What It Does
- Handles the **UI and state** for:
  - Queue system
  - Accept/ready phase
  - Captain draft & map veto
  - Match lobby with connect info
- Displays live player data via **WebSocket updates**
- Integrates with the backend using secure Axios requests and JWT cookies

## ðŸ’¡ Why I Built It
The goal was to give players a **Faceit-like interface** â€” smooth, modern, and responsive â€” without relying on any existing platforms.  
This frontend also serves as the base for the **Discord-verified access system**, ensuring only authorized users can join queues or matches.
