## 🚧 TODO - CS2 Integration (Next Phase)

### **CS2 Rank & Hours Tracking:**

To get CS2 rank and hours, you'll need to:

1. **CS2 Hours:**
   - Use Steam Web API endpoint: `IPlayerService/GetOwnedGames/v0001/`
   - Requires `steamApiKey` and `steamId`
   - Returns `playtime_forever` in minutes for CS2 (appid: 730)
   - Can be fetched on login or periodically

2. **CS2 Rank:**
   - ⚠️ **Problem:** Steam Web API doesn't expose CS2 competitive rank
   - **Solutions:**
     - Use FACEIT API (if users play FACEIT)
     - Scrape Steam profile (unreliable, breaks ToS)
     - Manual user input (not ideal)
     - Track rank through your own matchmaking system

3. **Implementation Plan:**
   - Add `cs2Hours` and `cs2Rank` fields to User model
   - Create utility function to fetch owned games from Steam API
   - Update on login or add "Refresh Stats" button
   - Display in profile page CS2 stats section

## 📝 NOTES

### **Current User Flow:**
1. User visits site → Redirected to `/login` (if not authenticated)
2. Clicks Steam button → Redirected to Steam OpenID
3. Logs in with Steam → Backend creates/updates user
4. JWT cookie set → Redirected to home page (`/`)
5. User data fetched and stored in Pinia
6. Navbar shows Steam avatar + username
7. Can access Profile page via dropdown
8. Can edit name/avatar on profile page
9. Can logout via dropdown

### **Admin Access:**
- Admin panel visible in dropdown only if `user.isAdmin === true`
- Currently defaults to `false` on user creation
- Can manually update in MongoDB: `db.users.updateOne({steamId: "YOUR_STEAM_ID"}, {$set: {isAdmin: true}})`

### **Discord Verification:**
- Backend has Discord verification logic ready
- Need to import existing Steam ↔ Discord mappings
- User mentioned having existing mappings (location TBD)

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

1. **Test the changes:**
   - Navigate site, test ROMISH home button
   - Check profile page displays correctly
   - Try editing profile name/avatar
   - Test logout functionality

2. **CS2 Stats Integration:**
   - Decide on rank tracking method
   - Implement Steam hours API call
   - Update profile page to show live data

3. **Discord Integration:**
   - Get existing Steam ↔ Discord ID mappings from user
   - Import to MongoDB
   - Set `isDiscordVerified: true` for matched users
   - Add "Verify Discord" button for unverified users

4. **Profile Picture Upload:**
   - Consider adding image upload instead of URL input
   - Integrate with cloud storage (Cloudinary, AWS S3, etc.)
